Hi, my name is Jorge Velasco. I’m an engineering manager at Con Edison, where I apply my background in energy engineering to help optimize NYC buildings. Currently, I’m pursuing a master’s degree in business analytics to sharpen my ability to make data-driven decisions and improve my work.

Outside of my career, I enjoy playing soccer and am a big sports fan, especially when it comes to football. I follow the Kansas City Chiefs largely because my grandmother is a huge fan, but I have to admit, I really enjoy the chaos of watching RedZone. I also like to unwind by watching reality TV shows with my kitten, Kita.

My journey is about continually growing in my field while staying connected to the things I enjoy.

Thank you for visiting my page!
